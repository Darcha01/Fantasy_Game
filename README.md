# These files make up the C code for a fantasy 1v1 PVP game that I created for my college programming class. 
#How it works is that the command line takes in the amount of champions they want to add to each deck. 
#A random list of champions are generated to each players deck, players could either be a Mage, Fighter, Tank, or Support. 
#The game then starts by pitting the first two characters in each players deck together and depending on the logic of who is battling who, different outcomes will result (ex. player one loses 1 champion, player two gains 1 champion). 
#After every turn, each player is given a random new champion to their deck. 
#The game goes until either one or both of the players no longer have any champions in their deck. 
#The person with no champions left loses and the other player wins. 
#If there are no champions in either players deck, then the game is a draw. 
#This was just a fun program to write that tested my ability to use concepts from my class such as some basic data structures and incorporating additional files into the main (like the source, header, and makefiles included).
#I might try to add the ability for each player to choose which champion they want to use for each turn so that it makes it feel more like an actual game, but as it stands right now, the game is a decent concept.
